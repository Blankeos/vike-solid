Solide is a demo showcasing a SolidJS framework built using [vite-plugin-ssr](https://vite-plugin-ssr.com/).

It uses VPS's [V1 design](https://github.com/brillout/vite-plugin-ssr/issues/578) which is work-in-progress.

To run the example:

- Clone the repo: `git clone git@github.com:magne4000/solide`
- Install dependencies: `pnpm install`
- Build Solide: `pnpm run build`
- Run the example: `cd examples/basic/ && pnpm run dev`
